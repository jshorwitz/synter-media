## Next Steps for Reddit Signup Tracking:

### 1. Enhanced UTM Tracking
The transformation is now live and will automatically extract UTM parameters from all future traffic.

### 2. Signup Event Implementation
To track Reddit signups, implement signup events in your application:
```javascript
posthog.capture('signup_completed', {
  signup_method: 'email',
  plan: 'free'
  // UTM parameters will be automatically added by the transformation
});
```

### 3. Create Reddit Signup Dashboard
Query for Reddit signups once signup events are implemented:
```sql
SELECT 
    utm_source,
    utm_campaign,
    count() as signups
FROM events 
WHERE event = 'signup_completed'
  AND utm_source = 'reddit'
  AND timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
GROUP BY utm_source, utm_campaign
```

### 4. Funnel Analysis
Create a funnel from Reddit pageview â†’ signup to measure conversion rates.
