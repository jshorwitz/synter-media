5. Edit the imported variables to add your real credentials
6. Hit "Deploy"

Should return: `{"ok":true,"db":true}`

## Getting OAuth Credentials

### Google OAuth (User Login)

4. Copy Client ID and Secret to Railway Variables

### Google Ads API (Campaign Data)

## Local Development
```bash
pnpm dev  # Runs API + workers with hot reload
```

## Common Commands
```bash
pnpm setup           # Interactive credential setup
pnpm dev             # Local development
pnpm build           # Build for production
pnpm railway:init    # Initialize Railway project
railway logs         # View deployment logs
railway run pnpm migrate  # Run database migrations
railway run pnpm seed     # Seed demo data
```

## Troubleshooting

**Build fails?**
- Check that all packages have valid `package.json` files
- Run `pnpm install` locally first

**Database connection fails?**
- Make sure MySQL plugin is added in Railway
- Check that `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, etc. are set correctly

**OAuth not working?**
- Verify redirect URIs match your Railway domain exactly
- Check that secrets are properly set in Railway Variables

**Still having issues?**
Run `railway logs` to see detailed error messages.
