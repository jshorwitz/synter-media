# Session Summary - Password Reset & Build Fixes

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Session Focus:** Implement forgot password functionality and fix deployment issues

---

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Forgot Password Link Not Working
**Problem:** The "Forgot password?" link on the login page was non-functional (just an anchor tag with `href="#"`)

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added a modal dialog triggered by clicking "Forgot password?"
- Integrated with existing `/api/auth/magic-link` endpoint
- Modal includes:
  - Email input field (pre-populated with login email if available)
  - Loading states during API call
  - Success message confirming email sent
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Close button and click-outside-to-close functionality

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`
  - Added state management for modal visibility and form handling
  - Added `handleForgotPassword` function to call magic link API
  - Implemented modal UI with matching design system styles
  - Added X icon import from lucide-react

**Technical Details:**
- Uses existing magic link infrastructure
- Sends POST to `/api/auth/magic-link` with email
- Creates or retrieves user account
- Generates 64-character hex token with 10-minute expiry
- Sends email with magic link to `{NEXTAUTH_URL}/auth/magic?token={token}`

### 2. Vercel Build Failure - Dashboard Page
**Problem:** Next.js build failing with error:
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat '/vercel/path0/apps/web/.next/server/app/(dashboard)/page_client-reference-manifest.js'
```

**Root Cause:** 
- Dashboard layout is a client component (`'use client'`)
- Dashboard page was using server-only `redirect()` function
- Next.js file tracing couldn't resolve the conflicting patterns

**Solutions Attempted:**

#### Attempt 1: Convert to Client-Side Redirect
- Changed dashboard page from server component to client component
- Replaced `redirect('/ppc')` with `useRouter().push('/ppc')`
- Added loading state UI
- **Result:** Build error persisted

#### Attempt 2: Remove Dashboard Page (Final Solution)
- Deleted `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx` entirely
- Users navigate directly to `/ppc` or other dashboard routes
- No redirect needed since all dashboard functionality is in sub-routes
- **Result:** Build successful

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx` (deleted)

## Magic Link Flow (Already Existing)

The forgot password feature leverages the existing magic link authentication flow:

### API Endpoint: `/api/auth/magic-link`
- **Method:** POST
- **Input:** `{ email: string }`
- **Process:**
  1. Look up user by email
  2. Create user with `role: 'viewer'` if doesn't exist
  3. Generate random 64-byte hex token
  4. Store in `magic_links` table with 10-minute expiry
  5. Send email via `sendMagicLinkEmail()`
- **Response:** `{ success: true, message: 'Magic link sent to your email' }`

### Database Tables Used
```sql
-- Users table
users (
  id, email, password_hash, name, role, 
  created_at, updated_at, is_active
)

-- Magic links table  
magic_links (
  id, user_id, token, created_at, 
  expires_at, used_at
)
```

### Email Template
- **Subject:** "Sign in to Synter"
- **Content:** Magic link with 10-minute expiry notice
- **Link:** `{NEXTAUTH_URL}/auth/magic?token={token}`

### Redemption Flow
- User clicks link â†’ GET `/auth/magic?token={token}`
- Token validated and marked as used
- Session created and cookie set
- User redirected to dashboard

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Click "Forgot password?" on login page
- [ ] Enter `joel@syntermedia.ai` in modal
- [ ] Submit and verify success message
- [ ] Check email for magic link
- [ ] Click magic link and verify login
- [ ] Verify dashboard loads at `/ppc`

## Architecture Notes

### Route Groups in Next.js
- `(dashboard)/` is a route group (parentheses don't affect URL)
- All routes inside inherit the dashboard layout
- No page at `/(dashboard)/page.tsx` means no content at root `/` path
- Sub-routes like `/ppc`, `/campaigns`, etc. still work normally

### Client vs Server Components
- Layouts with `'use client'` can only have client child pages
- Server functions like `redirect()` can't be used in client components
- Use `useRouter()` from `next/navigation` for client-side navigation

## Future Improvements

1. **Password Reset Email Template**
   - Customize email design to match brand
   - Add helpful context about why user received email
   - Include alternative support contact

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Add rate limiting to magic link endpoint
   - Prevent spam/abuse of email sending

3. **Analytics**
   - Track forgot password usage
   - Monitor magic link conversion rates

4. **User Experience**
   - Remember email across sessions
   - Add "Didn't receive email?" resend option
   - Show countdown timer for link expiry

5. **Security Enhancements**
   - Add CAPTCHA for forgot password requests
   - Implement account lockout after multiple attempts
   - Log magic link generation for security audit
