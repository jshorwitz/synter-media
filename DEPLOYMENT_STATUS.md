## ❌ **Deployment Challenges**

### **Issue 1: Railway Deployment**
- **Problem**: Railway deployed entire workspace instead of settings subdirectory
- **Cause**: Monorepo structure confusion
- **Status**: Needs manual Railway dashboard configuration

### **Issue 2: Vercel Deployment**
- **Problem**: Network issues with npm/pnpm registry
- **Cause**: Registry connectivity problems during build
- **Status**: Transient network issue, should work with retry

---

## 🎯 **Immediate Solutions**

### **Option 1: Manual Railway Configuration (5 minutes)**
1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.com/project/5c7189bb-19f4-4c68-b380-d9672a858ac9)
2. Click "settings" service → Settings
3. Set **Root Directory**: `packages/settings`
4. Set **Build Command**: `npm run build`
5. Set **Start Command**: `npm start`
6. Add Environment Variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL=file:./dev.db`
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
7. Redeploy

### **Option 2: GitHub Integration Deployment**
1. **Create separate settings repo**:
   ```bash
   cd /tmp
   cp -r /Users/joelhorwitz/dev/synter/packages/settings ./synter-settings
   cd synter-settings
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Settings panel"
   # Push to new GitHub repo
   ```
2. **Connect to Vercel/Netlify/Railway** from new repo

### **Option 3: Docker Deployment (Works Anywhere)**
```bash
cd packages/settings
docker build -t synter-settings .
docker run -p 3000:3000 synter-settings
# Deploy to any container platform
```

### **Option 4: Static Export (Easiest)**
```bash
# Add to next.config.js:
output: 'export'
# Then deploy static files anywhere
```
