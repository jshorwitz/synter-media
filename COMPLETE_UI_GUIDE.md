- Show only what's needed at each step
- Advanced options hidden by default
- Can skip and come back later

### 3. **Clear Visual Hierarchy**
- Step indicators show progress
- Status badges use color coding
- KPI cards highlight key metrics

### 4. **Smart Defaults**
- AI provides recommendations
- Fallback values if AI unavailable
- Sensible budgets and targeting

### 5. **Immediate Feedback**
- Loading states on all async actions
- Success/error messages
- Real-time deployment tracking
